Your code should comply to flake8 coding style. You can use this to check you code for errors:

    $ pip install flake8
    $ flake8 .
    client.py:17:17: E231 missing whitespace after ','


In client.py I left an coding style error in purpose. The flake8 script checks for errors and outputs to standard output. 
Actually you can install a flake8 plugin for atom or what ever editor you are using.
